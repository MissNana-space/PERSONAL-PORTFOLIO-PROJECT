    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I am a Psychology Student with a strong passion for understanding human behaviour. Over the course of my academic journey, I have actively pursued opportunities to contribute to the mental health sector. I have volunteered with platforms such as the 7 Cups of Tea, A Minute With a Psychologist and the Coalition for the Advancement of Nigerian Mental Health (CANMH). </p>
    <p> Outside of my academic work, I write under the pen name <strong> "ECHOES OF HER MIND."</strong> Through my writing, I express my thoughts and feelings about life and human behaviour. As I continue my studies, I hope to become a leading voice in raising mental health awareness and advocating for positive change</p>
